# TeraHz
TeraHz is a low-cost spectrometer based on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 3 B+ and three sensors:
 + [__AS7265x__](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/compact-as7265x-spectrometer/)
 is a 18 channel spectrometer chipset that provides the device with spectral data
 + [__VEML6075__](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15089) is an
 UVA/UVB sensor
 + [__APDS-9301__](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14350) is a calibrated illuminance (lux) meter that provides the device with reliable readings

## Why?
Because people and institutions could use an affordable and accurate light-analysing device that is also portable, easy to use and simple to assemble. TeraHz was started as an answer to our high school not being able to afford a commercially available solution. One TeraHz spectrometer costs around 150$ in parts, which makes it a competitive alternative to other solutions on the market today.
